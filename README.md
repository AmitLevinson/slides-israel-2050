### Slides about Analyzing and Visualizing data in R

This repo contains slides for a presentation I gave for a political activists group I used to attend. As someone who only learned SPSS during my BA & MA, The slides focus on features I found fascinating in R such as working with data, Rmarkdown, visualizations and gathering online data like twitter tweets.
